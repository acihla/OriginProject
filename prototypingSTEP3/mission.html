The plan is to use readily available devices and market the importance of knowing where your food comes from and why its process of production is important. Eventually the same idea can be applied to all consumer goods. Origin will require a mobile application that can scan barcodes and pull up the history and background of a goods production. It will also require a mature database populated by producers and regulated by Origin employees to make sure that data is accurate and certified. Again, a cross-platform, html-based application would be most appropriate and would cater to the largest group of users. </p></div></div>
