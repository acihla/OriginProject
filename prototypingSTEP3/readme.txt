This project does not utilize a database and is therefore filled with dumby-data. To simulate realistic use. Only click on pieces that are explored in the video (ie. Mary Dairy). State changes are only temporary but they are used to communicate the plan for future implementation(ex. adding to favorites doesn't actually add to favorites but the application is simply organized in such a way to simulate the addition).
